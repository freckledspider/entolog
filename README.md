# Entolog
> Entolog is an application that allows you to keep track of insects you have pinned in your physical collection.
> Live demo [_here_](https://).


## General Information
- This application was made in order to keep a log of a sometimes too large insect collection. 
- Instead of having to sort through actual specimens or touch them possibly damaging them, this can provide a digital log to keep track.
- I chose this concept since I enjoy collecting pinned insects and identifying them and took entomology as one of my classes towards my bachelor's degree in biology.
